# Middleware and Its Usage

## What is Middleware?

Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. In the context of web development, middleware refers to functions or software components that sit between the client request and the server response. Middleware functions have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Middleware can perform various tasks such as:

Executing code
Modifying the request and response objects
Ending the request-response cycle
Calling the next middleware function in the stack

## Types of Middleware

1. **Application-level Middleware**  
   These middleware functions are bound to an instance of the application and can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, or parsing request bodies.

2. **Router-level Middleware**  
   Middleware bound to an instance of the router. Useful for modularizing routes.

3. **Error-handling Middleware**  
   Middleware specifically designed to handle errors in the request-response cycle. It has four parameters: (err, req, res, next).

4. **Built-in Middleware**  
   Middleware provided by frameworks or platforms, e.g., Express's express.json() or express.static().

5. **Third-party Middleware**  
   Middleware created by the community to handle tasks like cookies, sessions, CORS, etc.
