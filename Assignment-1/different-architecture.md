# üèõÔ∏è Different Software Architectures

This document highlights the distinctions among various software architecture types, explaining their key characteristics, advantages, and differences.

---

## 1. **Monolithic Architecture**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Key Characteristics
- Entire application is built as a **single deployable unit**.
- Typically follows a **layered structure**: UI, Business Logic, Data Access.
- Simple to develop and deploy in the early stages.

### ‚ûï Advantages
- Simple to develop initially.
- Easy to test in small projects.
- Straightforward deployment process.

### ‚ûñ Disadvantages
- Becomes **hard to maintain** as codebase grows.
- Any change requires redeploying the **entire application**.
- Limited scalability (**horizontal scaling is complex**).
- Tight coupling between components.

---

## 2. **Microservices Architecture**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Key Characteristics
- Application is composed of **independent services**, each responsible for a single functionality.
- Services communicate over the network (usually via **HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues**).
- Each service can use its own **database, tech stack, and deployment pipeline**.

### ‚ûï Advantages
- **Independent deployment and scaling** of services.
- Better **fault isolation**.
- Technology diversity possible.
- Scales well for **large teams and distributed systems**.

### ‚ûñ Disadvantages
- More **complexity in managing deployments, communication, and monitoring**.
- Requires **robust DevOps and CI/CD pipelines**.
- Higher **latency** due to inter-service communication.

---

## 3. **Serverless Architecture**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Key Characteristics
- Applications are built as a collection of **stateless functions (FaaS: Function as a Service)**.
- No server management; infrastructure is **fully managed by cloud providers** like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.
- Pay only for execution time.

### ‚ûï Advantages
- Extremely **cost-effective** for sporadic workloads.
- **Highly scalable** by design.
- No infrastructure management overhead.

### ‚ûñ Disadvantages
- **Cold start latency**.
- Tight coupling with specific **cloud platforms (vendor lock-in)**.
- Limited execution time and resource constraints.

---

## 4. **Event-Driven Architecture**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Key Characteristics
- System reacts to **events** emitted by various components.
- Typically involves **producers, consumers, and message brokers** (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- Promotes **loose coupling** and **asynchronous communication**.

### ‚ûï Advantages
- High **scalability and resilience**.
- Allows **decoupling of services**.
- Real-time processing capabilities.

### ‚ûñ Disadvantages
- Increased **system complexity** in debugging and tracing.
- Eventual consistency can be harder to manage.

---

## 5. **Layered (N-Tier) Architecture**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Key Characteristics
- Divides application into **logical layers** such as:
  - Presentation Layer
  - Business Logic Layer
  - Data Access Layer
- Each layer communicates only with its adjacent layer.

### ‚ûï Advantages
- Good for **separation of concerns**.
- Simplifies development and maintenance for medium-sized apps.

### ‚ûñ Disadvantages
- Can become **rigid and inflexible** in complex applications.
- Performance overhead due to multiple layer traversals.

---

## 6. **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Key Characteristics
- Core business logic is isolated from **external dependencies**.
- Interactions with databases, web frameworks, and APIs happen through **ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations)**.

### ‚ûï Advantages
- Highly **testable and maintainable**.
- Promotes **separation of concerns** and loose coupling.

### ‚ûñ Disadvantages
- **Steeper learning curve**.
- Adds some **architectural overhead** to smaller projects.

| Architecture Type     | Scalability | Complexity | Deployment | Coupling  |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Monolithic            | Low         | Low ‚Üí High | Simple     | Tight     |
| Microservices         | High        | High       | Complex    | Loose     |
| Serverless            | Very High   | Moderate   | Managed    | Loose     |
| Event-Driven          | High        | High       | Complex    | Loose     |
| Layered               | Moderate    | Low ‚Üí Moderate | Simple | Medium    |
| Hexagonal             | Moderate    | Moderate   | Simple     | Loose     |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **Monolithic** ‚Üí Best for small teams and simple apps.
- **Microservices** ‚Üí Best for large, complex, and scalable systems.
- **Serverless** ‚Üí Best for highly scalable, event-based workloads with unpredictable traffic.
- **Event-Driven** ‚Üí Best for reactive, asynchronous systems.
- **Layered** ‚Üí Best for medium-sized, maintainable applications.
- **Hexagonal** ‚Üí Best when business logic must be independent of frameworks and external systems.
